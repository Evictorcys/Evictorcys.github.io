# Introduction

## Machine Learning Definition:
 - A computer program is said to learn
from experience E with respect to some task T
and some performance measure P, if its
performance on T, as measured by P, improves
with experience E.

## Machine Learning Algorithms:
 - Supervised learning
 - Unsupervised learning
 - Others: Reinforcement learning,recommender systems.

### Supervised Learning('right answers' given):
 - Regression:Predict continuous valued output
 - Classification:Discrete valued output

### Unsupervised Learning:
 - Cluster
