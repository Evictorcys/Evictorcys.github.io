## Introduction
A random walk with restart is a stochastic process to traverse a graph, resulting in a probability distribution over the vertices corresponding to the likelihood those vertices are visited. This probability can be interpreted as the relatedness between nodes in the graph. The random walk starts with an initial distribution over the nodes in the graph, propagating the distribution to adjacent vertices proportionally, until convergence.
## Formula
Let T be the transition matrix of the graph, with ![Machine_learning_image!]({{ '/styles/images/T_i_j.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}) being the probability of reaching entity ![Machine_learning_image!]({{ '/styles/images/e_j.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}) from entity ![Machine_learning_image!]({{ '/styles/images/e_i.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}),which can be computed as follows::<br>
![Machine_learning_image!]({{ '/styles/images/RWS_T.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }})<br>
in which ![Machine_learning_image!]({{ '/styles/images/N_e_i.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}) is the set of entities directly reachable from ![Machine_learning_image!]({{ '/styles/images/e_i.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}), and ![Machine_learning_image!]({{ '/styles/images/w_i_j.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}) is the weight of the edge between ![Machine_learning_image!]({{ '/styles/images/e_i.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}) and ![Machine_learning_image!]({{ '/styles/images/e_j.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}) ,defined as the number of their co-occurrences in the knowledge base.
Let ![Machine_learning_image!]({{ '/styles/images/r_t.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}) be the probability distribution at iteration t, then ![Machine_learning_image!]({{ '/styles/images/r_t1.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}) is computed as follows:<br>
![Machine_learning_image!]({{ '/styles/images/RWS_R.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }})<br>
where Î» is restart probability S is the preference vector (in order to avoid the issues caused
by sinks and guarantee convergence). <br>
Formally, the random walk model can be modeled as:<br>
![Machine_learning_image!]({{ '/styles/images/RWS_F.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }})
